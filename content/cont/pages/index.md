In **Hugo**, pages are the core of your site. Once it is configure, pages are definitely the added value to your documentation site.

## Folders

Organize your site like [any other Hugo project](https://gohugo.io/content/organization/). Typically, you will have a *content* folder with all your pages.

    .
    └── content
        ├── brace
        |   ├── yourselves.md   <- http://example.com/brace/yourselves/
        |   ├── winter
        |   |   └── index.md    <- http://example.com/brace/winter/
        |   └── index.md        <- http://example.com/brace/
        ├── is
        |   ├── coming.md       <- http://example.com/is/comming/
        |   └── index.md        <- http://example.com/is/
        └── ned-stark.md        <- http://example.com/ned-stark/

At that time, **Hugo-theme-learn** supports **only one level** inside a chapter. So you **can't** have http://example.com/chapter1/chapter1.1/page
{{% /notice %}}

## Types

**Hugo-theme-learn** defines two types of pages. *Default* and *Chapter*.

A *Chapter* is a page that contains another page. Commonly, it contains a simple title and a catch line to define content that can be found under it.
You can define any HTML as prefix for the menu. In the example below, it's just a number but that could be an [icon](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

    ### Chapter 1

    # Basics

    Discover what this Hugo theme is all about and the core-concepts behind it.


A *Default* page is any other content page.

    **Hugo-theme-learn** is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and modern static website engine written in Go. Where Hugo is often used for blogs, this theme is fully designed for **technical documentation**.

    This theme is a partial porting of the [Learn theme](http://learn.getgrav.org/) of [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), a modern flat-file CMS written in PHP.

    This current documentation has been statically generated with Hugo with a simple command : `hugo -t hugo-theme-learn`

To tell **Hugo-theme-learn** to consider a page as a chapter, just set `chapter: true` in the [front-matter headers]({{< relref "#front-matter" >}}).

**Hugo-theme-learn** provides [archetypes](/cont/archetypes) to help you create this kind of pages.

## Front Matter

Each Hugo page has to define a [Front Matter](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/) in *yaml*, *toml* or *json*.

**Hugo-theme-learn** uses the following parameters on top of the existing ones :

```toml
+++
# Set to true, it automatically generates a table of contents, available in the top of the screen.
toc = "false"
# Path to previous page. If set, add a previous arrow button on page
prev = ""
# Path to next page. If set, add a next arrow on page
next = ""
# Set a page as chapter, in another words, a page that contains other pages. Changes the display and behavior of the page
chapter = "false"
# Set HTML in this parameter. The chapter title in the menu will be prefixed by this. Useful for icons.
icon: ""
+++
```

## Ordering

Hugo provides a [flexible way](https://gohugo.io/content/ordering/) to handle order for your pages.

The simplest way is to use `weight` parameter in the front matter of your page.

### Menu ordering

If you don't like generated menu ordering, which is done alphabetically by default, you
can explicitly define sections ordering in `config.toml`.

For site with following `tree content`:
```
content/
├── about
│   ├── content.md
│   ├── index.md
├── bar
│   ├── index.md
│   └── mode_bar.md
├── foo
│   ├── foo2.md
│   └── index.md
└── introduction
    ├── index.md
    └── blabla.md
```

You can set menu ordering as:

1. about
2. introduction
3. foo
4. bar

all you need is to add menu definition in `config.toml`:
```
[params]
  menu = [ "about", "introduction", "foo", "bar" ]
```
